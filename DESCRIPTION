Description: Uses a Verbal Autopsy Expert Algorithm to assign causes of death using 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire data. 
    odk2EAVA() convert the data to a standard input format and codEAVA() uses the presence and absence of signs and symptoms 
    reported in the Verbal Autopsy interview to diagnose common causes of death. A deterministic algorithm assigns a single cause 
    to each Verbal Autopsy interview record, using a hiearchy of all common causes for neonates or children 1 to 59 months of age.
