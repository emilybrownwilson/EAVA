Description: Uses a Verbal Autopsy Expert Algorithm to assign causes of death using 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire data. odk2EAVA() convert the data to a standard input format and codEAVA() uses the presence and absence of signs and symptoms reported in the Verbal Autopsy interview to diagnose common causes of death. A deterministic algorithm assigns a single cause to each Verbal Autopsy interview record, using a hierarchy of all common causes for neonates or children 1 to 59 months of age.
