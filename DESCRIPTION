Description: Uses Expert Algorithm Verbal Autopsy to assign causes of death to 2016 WHO Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire data. odk2EAVA() converts the data to a standard input format and codEAVA() uses the presence and absence of signs and symptoms reported in the Verbal Autopsy interview to diagnose common causes of death. A deterministic algorithm assigns a single cause of death to each Verbal Autopsy interview record using a hierarchy of all common causes for neonates or children 1 to 59 months of age.
