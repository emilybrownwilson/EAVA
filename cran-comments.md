## Resubmission
This is the third submission. In this version I have:

* Referenced an archived R package, which odk2EAVA() builds upon, in description field of DESCRIPTION file
* Removed quotes around Expert Algorithm Verbal Autopsy for consistency
* Added small executable examples in man/...Rd files to illustrate function use and enable testing
* Changed cat() to message() in R/odk2EAVA.R

## Changes in the previous resubmission

* Removed Author field that differed from Authors@R 
* Added imports to NAMESPACE
* Defined globalVariable age in zzz.R

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.
